# Golden Globes Project
#### Team 13
#### Members: Lyon Zhang, David Zane, Christine Garver

We wrote separate python files for each function called in gg_api.py. We use NLP to find information about the Golden Globe awards (hosts, presenters, winners, nominees, best/worst dressed, overall sentiment). This program should be generalizable to other awards shows.

### get_hosts:
For get_hosts, we filtered the tweets for the word 'host' and removed tweets that had the phrase 'next year' in it. Then we got the list of people mentioned using Spacy and chose the top 2 most mentioned people.

### get_awards:
For get_awards, we filtered the tweets for key verbs such as 'best' and 'goes'. Then, we looked for the most common words in the tweets after best (that were not stopwords). We took the most common unique token words and reported those as the awards.

### get_winners:
For get_winners, we filter tweets for keywords from the specific award. Then we use a dictionary to track the people mentioned in tweets and the number of times they are mentioned. We return the most mentioned people.

### get_nominees:
For nominees, we filtered the tweets for the key words from the award and key verbs such as 'should have won', 'best', 'didn't win', etc. Then we extracted names from the tweets and stopped extracting names in a tweet when we hit a word from an end_word list that had words such as 'award', 'drama', etc. Then we returned the most mentioned people.

### get_presenters:
For get_presenters, we filtered the tweets for keywords from the specific award. Therefore, we removed stopwords and other words such as 'miniseries' that many people did not use to describe a certain award. Then we filtered the remaining tweets for key presenting verbs, such as: introduce, read, give, announce, etc. Next, we used Spacy to find the full names of people mentioned. In order to prevent from retrieving the winner's name, we made sure the name mentioned came before the key verb because most of the time winners are mentioned after the key verb. After filtering for similarities between the list of remaining names (to make sure we weren't counting nicknames for people as 2 different people), we returned the 2 most mentioned people in the tweets.

### Extra Functions:
**Red Carpet:**
<br> For red carpet, we return the 5 best dressed, 5 worst dressed, and 5 most controversial dressed people of the night. First we filter for tweets with the words 'best dress' and 'worst dress'. Then we create a dictionary of names and every time a person is mentioned, the counter for best dress or worst dress increments. We return the 5 highest best dressed, 5 highest worst dressed, and 5 most controversial scores. We define a score as controversial if the ratio between 'best dress' and 'worst dress' is close to 1.
<br>
<br>**Sentiment:**
<br> For sentiment, we used the library TextBlob in order to determine how people were tweeting about the awards show. We created linear counters of sentiment from 'ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS' to 'ASTRONOMICALLY BEAUTIFULLY WONDERFUL'. We returned the most common sentiment and the average positive and negative scores among the tweets.

### How to Run
1. Download and unzip folder.
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` for Python2 or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` for Python3.
3. Run: `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm` to download spacy library.
4. Make sure tweet data is in same directory and saved as a json with the name format 'gg' + year.
5. Run `python3 autograder.py 2013` to get the information about the awards show from year 2013. 2013 can be replaced with another year to get information from another year.
6. To run the extra function redcarpet.py, run `python3 redcarpet.py 2013` to get the information about the best and worst dressed from year 2013. 2013 can be replaced with another year to get information from another year.
7. To run the extra function sentiment.py, run `python3 sentiment.py 2013` to get the information about the best and worst dressed from year 2013. 2013 can be replaced with another year to get information from another year.
